# Loading MNIST handwritten digit database with Octave or MATLAB

The MNIST handwritten digit database is a very popular data set for testing machine learning algorithms. It contains 60,000 labeled training examples and 10,000 examples for testing. The data set can be downloaded from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This repository contains a file `mnist.mat` created from this data set which can easily be loaded with Octave or MATLAB. 

Either you can use this file directly or you can create it with the `mnist.py` Python script contained in this repository.

## Loading the data set directly in Octave/MATLAB

Download the file:

    wget https://github.com/daniel-e/mnist_octave/raw/master/mnist.mat

Start Octave and type:

```matlab
d = load('mnist.mat');
```

Now, `d` is a struct which contains the training and testing examples with the corresponding labels:
* `d.trainX` is a (60000,784) matrix which contains the pixel data for training
* `d.trainY` is a (1,60000) matrix which contains the labels for the training data
* `d.testX` is a (10000,784) matrix which contains the pixel data for testing
* `d.testY` is a (1,10000) matrix which contains the labels for the test set

You could now display a single example. For example, to display the third example of the training set type the following:

```matlab
X = d.trainX;
i = reshape(X(3,:), 28, 28)';
image(i);
```


## Create an Octave/MATLAB file from the raw data set

If you want to build the `mnist.mat` file on your own just follow the following steps:

First, you require some Python packages. This step is optional if you already have all packages installed. You can either install the required packages directly into your system with `pip` or you can create a virtual environment into which the packages are installed.

**Install packages directly**

    pip3 install scipy numpy matplotlib

**Install the packages into a virtual environment**

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    # activate the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install scipy numpy matplotlib


**Download the raw data set**

If you cloned the GitHub repository this step is optional as the repository already contains the files. If you haven't cloned it you have to download the data set from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz

**Execute mnist.py to create a matrix for Octave and MATLAB.**

    ./mnist.py

A new file `mnist.mat` is created which contains the data. This matrix can now be loaded with Octave or MATLAB as described above.
